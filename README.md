Just a learning exercise for me in JavaSciript MVC with Backbone. It isn't pretty but you might be able to learn something from it. I definitely did!

Despite it's looks, the code is pretty solid and allows you to...

 * Add todos
 * Toggle individual todos as done
 * Toggle all todos as done in one click
 * Delete individual todos
 * Delete all done todos in one click
 * Show edit tools for a todo
 * Save an edit
 * Cancel an edit without saving

I have covered quite a few things that can be done with Backbone, so enjoy my examples!
